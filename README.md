Project Description

Things With Feelings is a playful web app that gives inanimate objects voices, emotions, and completely unnecessary relationship advice. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it lets you apologize to your stuff, check its compatibility, reveal its secret wishes, and even hear it apologize back — all for no reason other than fun.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Inanimate objects are neglected, emotionally misunderstood, and often forced into awkward pairings with other items. While humans enjoy therapy, dating apps, and personalized wish lists, everyday objects like mugs, socks, and chairs remain voiceless in matters of feelings and relationships.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Things With Feelings is a delightfully useless web app that gives your possessions a voice. It lets you apologize to them, measure their compatibility, reveal their secret wishes, and even hear them apologize back — ensuring your stuff gets the over-the-top emotional attention it never asked for.
